The **McKinsey Forecasting Predictor**'s aim is to help to solve a problem a McKinsey & Company's client has proposed them and use our solution to improve their client's performance.

It does so by developing a model for sales forecasting using Machine Learning and Neural Networks techniques. 

We have used Python, TensorFlow and presented our ideas in a Jupyter Notebook.
